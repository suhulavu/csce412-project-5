                    <h2>Suhu Lavu</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Suhu Lavu and I am currently a junior at Texas A&M University majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics
                        and statistics. My academic and professional experiences have definitely amplified passion for computer science and I'm truly excited 
                        to continue to grow as a student, researcher, and aspiring data scientist. As an undergraduate research assistant, I've had the opportunity 
                        to contribute to real world problems in the fields of applied machine learning in healthcare, computer vision, and generative artificial 
                        intelligence. One project that I'm particularly proud of was the development of an early warning system for patients affected by hypertension.
                        Using deep learning and frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, we were able to successfully develop a predictive model that would allow
                        clinicians to detect the onset of hypertensive events in patients enrolled in a telemonitoring program. The project introdcuced me to the 
                        intricacies of machine learning and data science and our work will even be published at the upcoming IEEE International Conference on Body Sensor
                        Networks in October of this year. My professional experiences have also deepened my appreciation for the practical applications of computer science.
                        This past summer, I completed an internship in data science, where I had the opportunity to learn about the application of technologies such as Microsoft 
                        SQL Server and machine learning in an industry setting, furthering my knowledge of the field and better preparing me for a professional career in data
                        science. Furthermore, because of the interdisciplinary nature of our project, I was also able to gain an in depth understanding of working in cross-functional 
                        teams and explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.Beyond the classroom, I am also an avid basketball player, regularly competing in 
                        our univeristy's intramural league, and an enjoyer of all cuisines. My roommates and I frequently visit new restaurants to experience new flavors and 
                        cultures.
