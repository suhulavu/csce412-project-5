                <h2>The Big Event</h2>
                <p>The Big Event at Texas A&M is an organization that is dedicated to community-driven service. It gives back to the community 
                    by organizing a massive, annual day of volunteering where thousands of students come together to support local residents, 
                    non-profits, and local projects. I am drawn to the Big Event's mission because it represents the opportunity to make a 
                    meaningful impact in the lives of others and contribute to the betterment of our local community. By joining this organization, I hope to

                    Through engineering expertise and community-driven projects, the organization works tirelessly to improve access to clean water, sanitation, 
                    and other critical resources. I am eager to join Engineers Without Borders because I believe that engineering, inclduing computer science, has 
                    the power to address pressing societal issues. By joining Engineers Without Borders, I'll have the opportunity to apply the knowledge I've 
                    gained during my academic and professional experiences to directly benefit those in need and leave a lasting impact on communities around the world.</p>
