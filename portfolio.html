                <h2>Book Recommender System</h2>
                <p>This project involved the development of a hybrid recommendation system designed to provide book recommendations 
                    by combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches. The project leveraged the goodbooks-10k dataset, 
                    comprising six million ratings for ten thousand popular books on Goodreads, complete with metadata, tags, shelves, and genres. To enhance the content-based 
                    filtering aspect, book descriptions were scraped from Goodreads using the BeautifulSoup library. The collaborative filtering component employed the NeuMF 
                    model in TensorFlow, which combines matrix factorization and neural collaborative filtering techniques. The content-based filtering utilized TF-IDF 
                    vectorization and an autoencoder model for dimensionality reduction, facilitating book similarity calculations via cosine similarity. A hybrid recommender 
                    system was established by clustering each book's learned embeddings from both approaches using K-Means. When users requested book recommendations, 
                    candidates were selected from these clusters, and cosine similarity scores were aggregated across the three embedding spaces. Ultimately, the top "K" 
                    book recommendations were generated based on these ranked scores, offering users a personalized reading list. This comprehensive approach ensured that 
                    users received tailored book recommendations, enriching their reading experience based on both collaborative and content-based preferences.</p>

                <h2>Stock Forecasting</h2>
                <p>This project aimed to analyze and predict the closing price and volatility of stocks from Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Meta. 
                    I started by fetching raw stock price data using the Yahoo Finance Python library and then determining the order of differencing required to 
                    achieve stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. The selection of optimal parameters for the ARIMA model was guided by PACF 
                    and ACF plots, with AIC serving as the criterion for parameter selection. Post-model training, thorough analysis of residuals was conducted 
                    through diagnostic plots and statistical tests, including the Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation and the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity. 
                    In cases where results indicated variance changes over time, the GARCH model was employed to capture the volatility of returns. This multifaceted 
                    approach involved statistical testing, ARIMA modeling, GARCH modeling, and data visualization, with dependencies on libraries such as yfinance, 
                    matplotlib, statsmodels, pandas, scikit-learn, arch, and tqdm. The project's objective was to provide insights into stock price movements and 
                    volatility, aiding in more informed investment decisions.</p>
